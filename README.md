# customer-churn-ml-practice
Practice project for learning machine learning fundamentals such as EDA, preprocessing, pipelines, and classification models using a customer churn dataset.

# Customer Churn Prediction (Practice Project)

⚠️ This project was created while learning machine learning fundamentals.

The goal of this notebook is to practice:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Building ML pipelines
- Training and evaluating classification models

This notebook intentionally includes exploratory steps and experiments
and is not intended to represent a production-ready ML solution.
